        <div class="highlight">
            <p>AI and ML are transformative technologies reshaping industries, economies, and daily life.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding AI and ML</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks such as reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data, improving their performance over time without explicit programming. </p>
        <p> Together, these technologies drive innovations in healthcare, finance, transportation, and more.</p>

        <h2>Types of AI</h2>
        <p>AI can be categorized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Narrow AI</strong>: Designed for specific tasks (e.g., virtual assistants, recommendation systems)</li>
            <li><strong>General AI</strong>: Remains theoretical and aims to replicate human-like cognitive abilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Machine Learning Techniques</h2>
        <p>ML techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supervised learning</li>
            <li>Unsupervised learning</li>
            <li>Reinforcement learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These power applications like fraud detection, image recognition, and autonomous vehicles. </p>
        <p>Deep learning, a specialized ML approach using neural networks, has revolutionized fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.</p>

        <h2>Impact and Applications</h2>
        <p>The impact of AI and ML is profound:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In healthcare, AI assists in diagnostics and drug discovery</li>
            <li>In finance, it enhances risk assessment and algorithmic trading</li>
            <li>Businesses leverage AI for customer insights and automation, improving efficiency</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
        <p>However, challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and job displacement require ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks.</p>

        <h2>The Future of AI and ML</h2>
        <p>As AI and ML continue to evolve, their potential to solve complex global problems—such as climate modeling and personalized education—grows exponentially. </p>
        <p>Responsible development and collaboration across industries will ensure these technologies benefit society while mitigating risks. </p>
        <p>The future of AI and ML promises unprecedented advancements, making them indispensable in the digital age.</p>
